# PrismLauncher-Portable-AutoUpdater
There are two scripts present, 

The Static script that requires you to change the path of your portable directory, you may use this for stuff like fetching updates every week using Task Scheduler or similiar. 

The dynamic script asks for the path on launch, if the folder has no existing launcher files it will just extract to that folder.
